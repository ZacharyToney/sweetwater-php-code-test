# How To Run

### cd sweetwater-test

### ./vendor/bin/sail up

## You may not need to run the command below but if formatting is weird it may help generate tailwind css
### npm run dev
## Make sure to add your database once your sail up has run (although this is probably self explainatory based off of the challenge)
